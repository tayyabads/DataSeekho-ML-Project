# DataSeekho-ML-Project
Hi fellas! DataSeekho have been the first E-learning platform for students who wants to master skills in Data Science, Machince Learning ,and  Data Analytics. There mission is to empower 1 million students in this field by the end of 2028. There sessions are useful for both type of learners, learners who wants to start from the scratch and the ones who have already been in this field. 
This project is the live example of "Actions speaks louder than words". I have been in this field for almost 2 years but always scared to touch the Machine Learning, maybe im just scared of the term "Prediction". Well cutting it short , this is my first ML project thanks to their ML BootCamp which encouraged me to overcome my fear of coding nd Prediction. 
This project implements each and every step from importing libraried to reading files , fro reading files to detect null values, duplicates, outliers and handling them. After handleing them performed EDA to discover useful insights which helps to predict the outputs based upon the historical data.
And at the very last Model Prediction , in which we took 3 classifiers to classify the data in to classes and make prediction and moving with the one which have the most accuracy score.
